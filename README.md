# DSA_PBL
This is my third semester project a Problem Based Learning (PBL). This problem has been taken from Kaggle website.In this repository I've used the concepts of DSA to handle the data.The PBL is based on the Crashes of a city from 2010 to 2018.

**1. PDF:**
        There is a PDF, which describes what to do in the PBL. It means there are questions in it.

**2. Word file:**
        => In this repository, the word file contains the codes of classes
        => Also in this word file Algorithm of the PBL is defined, you will feel easy to understand it.

**3. CSV File:**
        A CSV File in this repository contains the data of crashes, which we manipulte by using DSA concepts.

  **4. Codes of Classes:**
        Finally, You will find the codes of classes, which are dependent on each other.
